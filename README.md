# Functional Programming Kata with Ramda

This is a simple repo with incremental kata for learning `Functional Programming` with [Ramda Library](http://ramdajs.com/).

## Installation

Remember to installa node modules for dependency and run test:

```bash
npm install
npm run test
```

The `Mocha` test framework is included with `Babel` for transpile new Javascript features like spread operator.

## Why Functional Programming

Understand and use Functional Programming (FP) for:

- Open mind with a new programming paradigm;
- Write What and not How;
- Be more clear with a code more readable;
- A readable code is a code maintainable;
- Learn about pure functions, immutable state and functions as first class citizen;
- Increase you code quality with functional programming within object programming.
