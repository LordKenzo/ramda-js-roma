# Functional Programming Kata with Ramda

This is a simple repo with incremental kata for learning `Functional Programming` with [Ramda Library](http://ramdajs.com/).

## Installation

Remember to installa node modules for dependency and run test:

```bash
npm install
npm run test
```

The `Mocha` test framework is included with `Babel` for transpile new Javascript features like spread operator.

## Why Functional Programming

Understand and use Functional Programming (FP) for:

- Open mind with a new trend programming paradigm, but old one [Alonzo Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church);
- Write What and not How;
- Be more clear with a code more readable;
- A readable code is a code maintainable;
- Learn about pure functions, immutable state and functions as first class citizen;
- Increase you code quality with functional programming within object programming.
- Be more confortable with library like Redux, with concept like High Order Functions, High Order Components and Composition.

> Learning Functional Programming takes a while, so don't be rude with yourself and be patient. And, yes, Functional Programming is not only use functions in your code. You always use functions in your code right now with OOP.
